# MkDocs — Static Site Generator for Project Documentation

**MkDocs** is a fast, simple, and modern static site generator that’s designed specifically for building project documentation. It uses **Markdown** for content and **YAML** for configuration.  

---

## Key Features

- **Markdown-based**  
  Write your docs in plain Markdown files. Easy to learn, portable, and lightweight.  

- **YAML configuration**  
  Manage site structure and settings through a single `mkdocs.yml` file.  

- **Themes and customization**  
  Comes with a built-in theme and supports community themes (e.g., [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)).  

- **Fast live preview**  
  Built-in dev server with hot reloading for quick feedback during editing.  

- **Easy deployment**  
  Generate a fully static site (`mkdocs build`) that can be hosted anywhere — GitHub Pages, Netlify, Read the Docs, etc.
